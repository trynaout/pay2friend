Welcome to Friend2Pay, a seamless and secure peer-to-peer payment application. This project provides a full-stack solution for digital wallet functionalities, allowing users to sign up, manage their funds, and send money to friends with ease.

Key Features âœ¨
Secure User Accounts: Full user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure user data and sessions are always protected.

Digital Wallet: Every user gets a personal digital wallet to check their account balance in real-time.
